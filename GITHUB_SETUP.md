# GitHub Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Ready to Deploy!

Your AI Transformation website is ready for deployment. Here's how to get it on GitHub and Vercel:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new)**
2. **Repository name**: `ai-transformation-next` (or your preferred name)
3. **Description**: `AI Transformation LLC - Modern business website with contact form`
4. **Make it Public** (or Private if you prefer)
5. **Don't initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository

After creating the GitHub repository, run these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-transformation-next.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new)**
2. **Import your GitHub repository**
3. **Configure environment variables**:
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` = `re_hEvLEdyJ_KQRq9g8wPL2nJBGyMknNsaYA`
   - `FROM_EMAIL` = `onboarding@resend.dev`
   - `TO_EMAIL` = `info@aitransformationllc.com`
4. **Deploy!**

## Step 4: Test the Deployment

1. **Visit your deployed site**
2. **Fill out the contact form**
