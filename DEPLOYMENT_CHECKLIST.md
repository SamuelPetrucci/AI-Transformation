# Deployment Checklist - Email Notifications

## âœ… Pre-Deployment Setup

### 1. Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your Vercel project settings:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_hEvLEdyJ_KQRq9g8wPL2nJBGyMknNsaYA
FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
TO_EMAIL=info@aitransformationllc.com
```

### 2. Resend Configuration
- âœ… API key is valid and active
- âœ… Sending domain is configured (onboarding@resend.dev)
- âœ… Recipient email is correct (info@aitransformationllc.com)

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment - email notifications only"
git push
```

### 2. Verify Environment Variables
- Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables

### If emails aren't sending:

2. **Verify API key** - Test in Resend dashboard
3. **Check spam folder** - Emails might be filtered
4. **Verify domain** - Make sure sending domain is configured

### If form submission fails:
1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Check Vercel function logs** for API errors
